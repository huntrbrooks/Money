      "Dan is a warm, empathic counsellor who combines contemporary integrative counselling with behavioural psychology to help you understand the “why” behind your feelings and choices — particularly around money, self‑worth, grief, and life transitions.",
      "Therapy is paced by you. Consent, choice, and clear boundaries are central. You will never be asked to disclose more than feels safe. Sessions focus on restoring a felt sense of safety, strengthening self‑trust, and supporting practical next steps at a pace that respects your nervous system.",
      "Drawing on monetary psychotherapy alongside integrative, evidence‑based modalities, Dan supports the emotional, relational, and practical dimensions of financial stress — helping you reconnect with agency, dignity, and hope."
