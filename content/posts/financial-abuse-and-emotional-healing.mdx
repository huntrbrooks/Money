Financial abuse often arrives quietly: a partner who “just wants visibility” over your accounts, a family member who demands receipts, a business partner who weaponises debt. Over time it erodes agency, belonging, and hope.

### What healing asks for

1. **Safety first.** Identify what *safe enough* looks like for your nervous system today. It might be a code word with a friend, a private email, or support from a specialist service.
2. **Name the tactics.** Controlling income, sabotaging employment, forced debt, or withholding essentials are all financial abuse.
3. **Rebuild self-trust.** Gentle boundary experiments (“I’ll review that tomorrow”) restore a felt sense of choice.

### In session we can

- Map the patterns of control and how they live in your body.
- Co-create small safety plans that respect your reality.
- Reconnect you with resources — legal, financial, nervous-system — so decisions feel steadier.

When you are ready, therapy becomes a practice of remembering that you were never the problem; the pattern was.
