Maybe you oscillate between strict saving and sudden splurges. Maybe you buy gifts to soften hard conversations. Our spending habits often mirror the attachment strategies that once kept relationships intact.

### What spending can signal

- **Anxious attachment.** Purchases become proof of care or belonging.
- **Avoidant attachment.** Money is hoarded for escape plans or withheld to maintain distance.
- **Fawning.** Over-giving, surprise gifts, or picking up every bill to keep peace.

### Gentle experiments

1. Track the *feeling* before you spend. Are you tired? Lonely? Seeking approval?
2. Build a “joy + repair” line item. It legitimises pleasure **and** future course correction.
3. Practice micro-pauses: “What do I want to feel after this purchase?”

Over time, the goal isn’t perfect behaviour — it’s aligning money moves with the nervous system state you want to live from.
