Money is never *just* about dollars. It holds stories about safety, care, control, belonging, and what we learned love required. When finances wobble, the nervous system often reacts as though survival is at stake — even if the spreadsheet says you’re “fine”.

This article steps through the psychology of money anxiety and offers trauma-informed practices you can try between sessions.

## The nervous system isn’t dramatic — it’s protective

Your body doesn’t distinguish between a tiger and an unexpected rent increase. When money feels tight, these things can happen automatically:

- Cortisol spikes, tunnel vision narrows, and planning becomes hard.
- Fight/flight/freeze/fawn responses kick in: endless spreadsheeting, avoidance, or pleasing others to regain safety.
- Avoidance grows the problem, which then *proves* to the body that money is dangerous.

> **Story — Sam and the unopened bills.** Growing up with periodic evictions, Sam’s body still equates envelopes with danger. Avoidance leads to late fees, reinforcing the fear. The loop is neurological, not moral.

## Attachment and family conditioning

We often internalise the rules modelled around money:

- **Anxious attachment.** Compulsively refreshing bank apps or chasing reassurance from partners.
- **Avoidant attachment.** Hiding accounts or shutting down when budgets are raised.
- **Disorganised patterns.** Swinging between strict saving and impulsive spending.

When approval, love, or freedom depended on what you contributed financially, balances can feel like report cards on worth.

## Financial trauma shows up somatically

Financial trauma can come from coercive control, sudden job loss, migration stress, or generational scarcity. Money cues can resurrect helplessness even years later.

> **Story — Leo and the pay review.** Humiliated by a former boss, Leo’s body still braces for attack when a salary email arrives. New workplace, same alarm.

## Shame is a smoke screen

When net worth becomes self-worth, mistakes feel like identity failures. Shame silences questions and fuels extremes: overwork to “earn” worth or overspend to self-soothe. Reframing the story — “This reaction is my nervous system protecting me” — keeps you on your own side.

## How to begin healing your relationship with money

1. **Regulate before you plan.** 60 seconds of square breathing before opening banking apps signals “I’m safe enough”.
2. **Make safety visible.** Rename accounts: *Essentials*, *Safety Buffer*, *Joy & Freedom*, *Future Me*.
3. **Tiny money sprints.** Spend 10 minutes cancelling one subscription, opening mail, or moving $10. Consistency rewires more than grand gestures.
4. **Update the old story.** Identify the original money wound (“Bills = eviction”) and gently align with today’s realities.
5. **Practice repairing.** When mistakes happen, narrate them as data: “I was overwhelmed, so I reached for dopamine. Next time I’ll try a check-in first.”

If you’re experiencing coercion or financial abuse, prioritise physical and digital safety. A confidential emergency fund, code phrases with trusted people, and specialised support services can sit alongside therapy.
