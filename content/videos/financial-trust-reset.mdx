In this short video I cover:

- How to notice when a money decision is coming from fear vs. values.
- A three-part grounding exercise you can do before opening banking apps.
- Ways to ask for collaboration (instead of control) in shared finances.

Use it as a pre-session primer or a reminder between appointments.
